Traditional distributed systems perform distribution relying upon stable network infrastructures where hosts are permanently connected to the main net-
work through high-bandwidth and high-quality links. However, for mobile and
pervasive systems most of the distribution occurring among embedded devices
communicating with each other through radio medium, lacks of such reliable
communication links and it is thus more prone to congestion, collision, and interference.
Publish/subscribe (P/S) is an appealing communication primitive for such
networks due to the loosely coupled interaction between the publishers and subscribers. In this paradigm, publishers produce events and subscribers express
their interests through subscriptions. Any event matching the subscription is
delivered to the corresponding subscriber. In this manner the subscribers nor
the publishers do not use source/destination identifiers or addresses. This inherent the decoupling of publishers and subscribers.
