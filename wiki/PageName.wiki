*A-3*, is a model and a reconfigurable
middleware for designing and implementing high-volume and
highly volatile distributed systems.

===Introduction===

Traditional distributed systems perform distribution relying upon stable network infrastructures where hosts are permanently connected to the main network through high-bandwidth and high-quality links. However, for mobile and
pervasive systems most of the distribution occurring among embedded devices
communicating with each other through radio medium, lacks of such reliable
communication links and it is thus more prone to congestion, collision, and interference.
Publish/subscribe (P/S) is an appealing communication primitive for such
networks due to the loosely coupled interaction between the publishers and subscriber.

Pervasive distributed systems are usually supported by a middleware that is
in charge of keeping track of subscriptions and of dispatching the published messages to the interested subscribers. Middleware with multi layers can be installed on every node of a distributed system to provide a homogeneous high-level interface to applications for many aspects of a distributed computing environment, such as communication, concurrency, synchronization, replication, persistence,and access control.

The coordination is easier if, instead of attempting to coordinate large amounts of elements, the designer can concentrate on coordinating “groups” of elements that are less dynamic in their
behavior. Elements can be grouped together for a number of reasons: because
they are conceptually similar, because they have common goals, because they
are physically close, etc. Once the elements have been grouped, the designer
can exploit special communication abstractions, receive updated views of the
elements that are in the group, and perform state management.
